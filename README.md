# createPasswords
A script to create a slightly stronger "words" password than 1Password (or XKCD-password-generator).
The script, without any arguments, will return around an 18 character password with the following attributes:

1. lowercase letters
1. random english words
2. words separated with dashes
3. one random letter capitalized
4. one random letter replaced with a number

#TODO
1. allow different separator
2. allow more letters capitalized
3. allow more number replacement
4. allow longer or set lengths
